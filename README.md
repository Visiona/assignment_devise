# Practice with Devise Gem
========================

Simple simple assignment - building a scaffolded app, adding Devise, and exploring how it works.


## Getting Started

To get the app started locally you'll need to:

1. Clone the repo with `git clone REPO_URL`
2. `cd` into the project
3. Run
  - `$ bundle install`
  - `$ bundle exec rake db:migrate`
  - `$ bundle exec rake db:seed`
(# take a look around the schema file to see how models were created)

4. Start up the console with `rails c` command
